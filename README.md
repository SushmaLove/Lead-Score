# Lead-Score
Our task was to help X Education identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. The company wanted to build a model to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
